## Course Outline

The course is divided into 8 modules, each covering different aspects of c++ programming.

Here is an overview of the modules:

### 1. Introduction to c++

- why c++
  - static type lang vs dynamic type lang
  - what is STLs
  - multi-paradigm language [OOP-Procedural]
  - c++ standards

- comments
- escape character
- data types
- binary representation [signed-unsigned]
- manipulators [iomanip]
- global vs local variables
- operators
  - Arithmetic operators.
  - Comparison operators.
  - Assignment operators.
  - Logical operators.
  - Bitwise operators.
- operations priority
- if condition
- loops:
  - for.
  - while.
- Break.
- continue.

### 2. Deep Dive Into C++

- Functions
  - Default parameters
  - overload
  - mangle and demangle
- Arrays
- Pointers
- References
- auto dataType
- Casting
  - c-style cast
  - static cast
  - const cast
  - dynamic cast
  - reinterpret cast
- lambda expression
