# cout<< endl; Vs. cout<< "\n";

## When to Use Each Option

### Use `cout << endl;` When

- You want to ensure that the output is immediately visible to the user, and you want to flush the output buffer.
- You are printing text that is followed by user input, and you want to make sure the text is displayed before accepting input.

### Use `cout << "\n";` When

- You don't need immediate visibility of the printed output, and it's acceptable for the output to be buffered.
- Performance is a concern, and you want to minimize the overhead of flushing the buffer.

Remember that while `cout << endl;` flushes the buffer, it can have a slightly higher performance cost compared to `cout << "\n";`, which simply adds a newline character. Choose the option that best suits your specific use case.

By understanding the difference between `cout << endl;` and `cout << "\n";`, you can effectively control the behavior of your C++ output statements in different scenarios.
